            <p>My name is Isaac McNutt, and I am a Game Design and Development student at RIT. I have been using the
                Unity engine for over 6 years. Most of my projects

                    <h3>Mirror Maze</h3>
                    <p>
                        Mirror Maze is a game created for the 2019, GAME DEV club Game Jam at RIT. The theme of the jam
                        was "behind you".
                        <br>
                        In the game you play as a charector who is placed at the center of a maze and are required to
                        find 4 keys in order to exit.
                        However, in order to navigate the player must use a mirror!
                        <br>
                        <h3>Game Info:</h3>
                        Controls:
                        <ul>
                            <li>WASD to walk around.</li>
                            <li>Move mouse to look around.</li>
                            <li>Mirror to see footprints, and other things.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        Navigation:
                        <br> The easiest way to navigate the maze is to simply stick to a wall, however, with what could
                        be in the maze it is not always the safest option.
                        <br> Warning, the sound is quite loud.
                        <br> The game was the winner of the game jam.

                    <h3>Knight Light</h3>
                    <p>
                        Knight Light is a game created for the 2019, Wild Magic Game Jam. The theme of the
                        jam was "Tarot Cards".
                        In the game you play as a Knight who has a light and must clear rooms in an attempt to kill the
                        boss at the end, and save their son.
                        The player must navigate and find the enemies using only their meager light source.

                        <h3>Game Info:</h3>
                        Controls:
                        <ul>
                            <li>WASD to walk around.</li>
                            <li>Space to attack in the direction of previous and/or current movement.</li>
                            <li>Use light radius to see enemies.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        Combat:
                        <br> The easiest way to do combat is to simply take it slow, the controls can be a little hard
                        to get used to.
                        <br> Also, the sound is quite loud.
