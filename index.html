                <h1>Unity Marching Cubes</h1>
                <h3>Goal: </h3>
                <p>The goal was to create a fairly preformance friendly version of an infinate interactive terrain.</p>
                <h3>Description:</h3>
                <p>The project consists of a number of different implementations of marching cubes. In the "final"
                    version the user is able to pretty much explore the terrain to their hearts content. The user is
                    able to either paint terrain features or use the remove/add grenades. The reason I wanted to do this
                    project was twofold, first I have always desired a game that had interactive terrain ala minecraft
                    but not cube, and second to learn how to use marching cubes as I had previously tried like four
                    times.</p>

                <h3>Goal: </h3>
                <p>The goal was to create an interactive meta-balls projects, it is also supposed to be a tool to
                    visualize the various steps in the meta-balls process</p>
                <h3>Description:</h3>
                <p>The Interactive Meta Balls project is a project made using JavaScript canvas. The user is able to
                    change the direction the balls are moving, create new balls, and change a number of other things
                    about the enviroment. The user is also able to change what is drawn onto the canvas, for example,
                    they could change the drawing to only the anti-nodes and get a very different view of the meta-balls

                <h3>Goal: </h3>
                <p>Mirror Maze is a game created for the 2019, GAME DEV club Game Jam at RIT. The theme of the jam was
                    "behind you".</p>
                <h3>Description:</h3>
                <p> In the game you play as a charector who is placed at the center of a maze and are required to find 4
                    keys in order to exit. However, in order to navigate the player must use a mirror!</p>
                <h3>Game Info:</h3>
                <p>
                    Controls:
                <ul>
                    <li>WASD to walk around.</li>
                    <li>Move mouse to look around.</li>
                    <li>Mirror to see footprints, and other things.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                Navigation:
                <br> The easiest way to navigate the maze is to simply stick to a wall, however, with what could
                be in the maze it is not always the safest option.
                <br> Warning, the sound is quite loud.
                <br> The game was the winner of the game jam.

                <h3>Goal: </h3>
                <p>Knight Light is a game created for the 2019, Wild Magic Game Jam. The theme of the jam was "Tarot
                    Cards".</p>
                <h3>Description:</h3>
                <p>In the game you play as a Knight who has a light and must clear rooms in an attempt to kill the boss
                    at the end, and save their son. The player must navigate and find the enemies using only their
                    meager light source.</p>
                <h3>Game Info:</h3>
                <p>
                    Controls:
                <ul>
                    <li>WASD to walk around.</li>

                <br>
                Combat:
                <br> The easiest way to do combat is to simply take it slow, the controls can be a little hard
                to get used to.
                <br> Also, the sound is quite loud.

                <h3>Goal: </h3>
                <p>To create a multiplayer FPS in Unity.</p>
                <h3>Description:</h3>
                <p>This was my first real project I commited to (probably to early but we are ambitious as teenagers)
                    using Unity. It survived a total of like 6 differnt project resets, a
                    couple file curruptions and then eventually a complete system restore. At this stage, the files are
                    so spread out I doubt I will ever reconstruct the project. The latest version I have was from 2017,
                    however I know I started as early as 2015, and unfortunately due to Unity stuff you cannot even open
                    it. As for builds I have been able to find quite a few, unfortunately, it looks like the version of
                    Dropbox I used for years was wiped so the early version are gone. However in the linked mediafire
                    folder you can find some pretty early versions. Also the version labling means nothing I think I was
                    just randomly generating a number when I did it. Regardless, the project is essentailly a
                    rudimentary multiplayer FPS. It uses an early version of Photon Unity
                    Networking for the multiplayer.</p>
